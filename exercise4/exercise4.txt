Exercise 4: « A classy cat… » 6 points

You work for a local animal shelter. You must redesign their website.
You have to create a class named Cat() with the following properties:
- Name (string - 3 to 20 characters)
- Age (int)
- Color (string - 3 to 10 characters)
- Sex (string - male or female)
- Breed (string - 3 to 20 characters)
Make the getters/setters to validate the above data type. You also have to create the class
constructor in order to instantiate the class.
Add a getInfos() method to return all the properties as an array..
In a new file, instantiate the class to display 3 different cats and display the result with the
getInfos() method previously created.
