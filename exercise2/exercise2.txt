Exercise 2: « The trainee » 5 points

You are responsible for a trainee. He must get an user list from a database. He also must
add the ability to add new users with a form.

The main script is composed of 2 parts:

- The user list and their informations
- A form to add a new user

The trainee begins with PHP development. He doesn’t indent code and do not comment
code either. As his guide, you must help him and correct his code to make it fully functional.
The code must also be indented.

Steps:
1. Download the files at this address: http://wf3.axessweb.io/evaluations/php-sql/evaluation_docs.zip

2. Deploy index.php and connect.php files on your local server. Don’t forget to import the SQL
script users-install.sql. The script will create a new database with a table named “users”.

3. Help your trainee to debug his code, correct his mistakes and make it functional. */
